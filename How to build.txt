In order to build this project, you need to execute the psake build script from the PowerShell console.
You do this using the following command from the root project directory:

Debug build
	.\psake.ps1
	
or Release build
	.\psake.ps1 -properties @{config='Release'}
	
You may need to allow script execution by running the following command as adminstrator:

Also note that the build script assume that you have the following dependencies:
